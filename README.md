Previous topic: An android app that displays random facts. User can select facts from specific subjects, such as food etc.

Present topic: Due to the random fact api not working, I decided to change the app into a Chuck Norris joke/fact app. User can either fetch a random joke from the api or use keywords/tags to fetch jokes from different categories

Target: Android / Kotlin

Used API: https://api.chucknorris.io/
